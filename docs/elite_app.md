# Elite App

To improve the immersion, we are using a separate application to display
the webpage. It puts itself in the foreground and gets minimized once a
demo is entered.

The program opens "<https://dev.elite.fbi.h-da.de/>" by default. You can
also pass a different URL using the `url` parameter.

Use the parameter `local` to load a buildin version of the demo portal
(no internet or other external service needed).
