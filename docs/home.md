# Introduction

We live in a time of increasing digitalization which results in an
increased dependency on IT systems. This again leads to an increased
potential of harm, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) - "kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU)". In most cases, these
companies do not have a sufficient understanding of IT security and
clear competencies to act in the event of a an attack.

The aim of the project is to develop a platform that uses interactive
demonstrators in order to teach scenarios of common IT security attacks
and appropriate countermeasures. Additionally, it is supposed to provide
an easy-to-understand and accessible background knowledge i.e. with
posters, brochures and videos.

## Project Overview

The Gitlab-Group holds all repositories that emerged within the master
course "Experience Cyber Security".

1.  Demonstrations: This repository contains all demos for the platform
    as well as the nativeapp.
2.  Teaching: This repository holds the platform web application which
    controls the demos and contains the teaching material.
3.  Container Templates: This repository builds the needed basic
    containers to speedup build time for the project containers.

## Getting Started

The sidebar has an overview of the wiki entries. For a good starting
point read the following pages:

1.  [Setup of a Workstation (Client)](setup/client_setup.html)
2.  [Get Started with Demos](add_demo.html)

### MPSE Course "Experience Cyber Security"

Since the project was started, multiple teams have been contributing as
follows:

1.  Teaching/Web Platform: This team is responsible for implementing the
    general infrastructure of the ECS system and the platform itself.
2.  Demonstrations: This team is responsible for design and
    implementation of the demonstrations. The repository holds all the
    demonstrations of different scenarios (Phishing, Password, etc.)
3.  Teaching: Teaching Portal including all teaching material.
4.  Infrastructure: This team is responsible for the improvement of the
    CI/CD pipeline, quality control and the deployment process.
5.  Demo Improvement: This team is maintaining quality of the teaching
    material as well as the code quality of the native app and all
    demos.
6.  Drive-By Download: This demo is responsible for for creating the new
    drive-by download demo and the corresponding teaching material.
