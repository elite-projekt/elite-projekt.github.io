## Wording and writing Style

| The wording and writing Style should always be including the reader.
| It is important that the reader is always in a positive mindset.
| The reader should never get the feeling to be not intelligient enough
  to understand something or have other similiar negitive feelings.

| A good approach to include the reader is using the word **we**.
| On one hand words like *you* or in german *Sie* and *Du* can be
  avoided and on the other hand it gives a feeling of not beeing alone
  in the situation.

### Gendering

| Everything should be properly gendered to include everyone.
| A good way is trying to use gender neutral words.
| If not possible use **:** to gender words like *Nutzer* -\>
  **Nutzer:innen**

### Refering to another Course

| If another Course is mandotory for the Content, there should be a
  short introduction of the topic at the beginning of the course,
  followed by a link to the course refered to.
| Then the normal content of the Course follows.
